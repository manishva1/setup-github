to connect with github 
     ' git config --global user.name "manishva1" '

     ' git config --global user.email manishv9794@gmail.com '
then we have to clone our account with our computer
     ' git clone the https website'

as soon as connection will be stablished we can read that folder anytime

Now whatever file we have to upload we just have to follow the commands
     ' git add filename'
     
     ' git stutus'

and after adding file we have to commit our changes so
     ' git commit -m "comments" filename '

and then we will push the folder in github after commited file
     ' git push -u origin master'
